Document selection is exactly what it sounds like. Any text highlighted within the document
will be considered a selection. This is useful, but not what I want. Will test to see if
possible to limit selection candidacy to a specific div.
Wrapping multiple paragraphs in a div doesn't work. Event does not fire. Will test on individual
paragraphs within that div.
Individual paragraphs in the div also don't work.  This seems to be because the selectionchange
event only applies to the entire doucment or input and textarea elements. Will test the textarea
to see if this might work.
